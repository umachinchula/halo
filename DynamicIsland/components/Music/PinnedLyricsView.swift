/// The line being sung, under the closed notch, for as long as lyrics are
/// pinned.
///
/// The side panel only exists while the notch is open, so pinning is the only
/// way to keep reading along without holding the pointer over the notch. Only
/// the current line is shown -- there is no room under a closed notch for a
/// list, and the line that matters is the one playing.
///
/// Applied as a modifier rather than added to the notch's stack, because the
/// notch panel sizes itself to its widest child and paints black behind the
/// result. Anything placed in that stack that reports a width -- a sized
/// `Text`, or a `GeometryReader`, which returns whatever width it is offered
/// and so claims the whole screen -- stretches the panel into a full-width
/// slab, and re-centres the music row inside it so the spectrum slides under
/// the physical notch cutout. Padding adds the height, and an overlay draws
/// the words into it: an overlay is proposed its parent's size and never
/// changes it.
